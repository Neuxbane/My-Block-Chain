# My-Block-Chain
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain](
A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).)

I was inspired by the following sources:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4

then, I wrote this code..

Note: The hash is contains the data it self.

## How to install
yourProject.js add line
`require('./neulock.js')`

## Example file:
- for terminal use `node main.js`
- for http server use `node server.js` require `node npm i express`
